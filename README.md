#Totally Blank Wordpress Theme

This is my basic HTML5 blank theme I use to start new Wordpress projects where having a CMS is as important as having a blog.

It is _not_ aimed at Wordpress beginners as it has no code except header and footer calls in any of the template files. The exception being:

- Header.php, which contains a basic HTML5 header
- Footer.php, which contains very basic footer info
- Functions.php, which contains a *lot* of custom functions. Please take a look at this file before you install this theme as it removes a lot of Admin functions.

The theme is styled using LESS but could easily be converted into SASS (or plain old CSS if you're not a LESS/SASS person) as it is, as is everything else, _very_ barebones.
